Hello, I'm Maxwell Lee and welcome to my GitHub page. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Southern California with a Master's in Applied Data Science and a Bachelor's in Applied and Computational Mathematics. I am currently searching for a full time job in the data science industry. 

Each folder here represents some of the work I've done during my time at USC. I hope you find that I've done quality work in a wide variety of important aspects to data science.
